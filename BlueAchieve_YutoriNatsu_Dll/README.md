## This is a character from Blue Archive

The MOD includes 1 workbench, 3 placeable decorations, 1 gun, and 3 food items.

She will spawn in the starting area.

Currently, she doesn't have any special dialogues or quests — maybe in the future.

She can use a skill that clears debuffs and heals, as well as a skill that increases both weapon and magic damage.

The workbench is used as a Valentine’s Day tea table. All items in this MOD are crafted on it, and crafting the tea table itself only requires a bit of manual crafting.

This Mod use ID:
