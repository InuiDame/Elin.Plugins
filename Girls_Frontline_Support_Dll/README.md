## How to make props for this MOD
In simple production, a MOD workbench can be created, where props for this MOD can be made.
  
## The item categories for this MOD are

+ Gun: A firearm corresponding to a humanoid form, which can also be used by players.

+ Humanoid Manufacturing Contract: The price is twice that of a gun, and the probability of summoning a humanoid without carrying a firearm is a bug. Please check carefully.

+ Black card: Create skin forms corresponding to the human form, with no difference in attributes from the original human form.

+ Proof of Oath: Create a pledge form corresponding to the human form, increase basic attributes by 10%, and have independent dialogue.

+ New Fire Control Unit: To create a MOD3 form corresponding to the human form, the reward obtained after making the oath form needs to be used as material for production. Its attributes will be fully upgraded and new skills will be obtained.
(Black card, proof of oath, new fire control units may become special equipment in the future to directly provide attributes and replace vertical drawings)

+ Firearms accessories: (can be carried and embedded into remote weapons)

+ Magazine: Neck accessory, providing hit and damage, inset provides magazine.

+ Accessories: Finger position jewelry, providing hit damage and other attributes, inlaid for various effects.

+ Exoskeleton: a dorsal accessory that provides avoidance or defense and other attributes, and cannot be embedded.

## Important Notes

I don't update this MOD very often; it's in a semi-abandoned state, but I still maintain it.
