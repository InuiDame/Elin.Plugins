    "Background": "Though the founder of alchemy may possess an immutable body, her heart remains ever-changing. \n As she travels the skies with her beloved apprentice and crewmates, what form will she ultimately embody at journey's end? \n Perhaps there is no such thing as completion in the nature of a person's existence.",
    "Background_JP": "不変の身体を持つ錬金術師の開祖であろうと、その心は移り変ろう。\n愛弟子や仲間と共に世を行くその心と身体は、旅の果て、いかなる姿に落着するか。\n人の在り方に、完成などないのかもしれない。"
