    "Background": "The fallen angels once imprisoned in Pandemonium have been returned to the state of precipian entities, \n and the fallen angel of incubation bears the burden of containing their vast energy—yet her wish is so modest it can never be granted. \n She only longs for everyone to live together in peace... in this painful yet beautiful world.",
    "Background_JP": "パンデモニウムに閉じ込められた堕天司達が還元された『狭間のモノ』。\nその膨大なエネルギーを抱き留める『抱卵』の堕天司の願いはささやか故に叶わない。\nただ、皆で平和に生きられたらいいのに……この、切なくも美しい世界で。"
